# pygame-board-point-collector

In this project I will make a small black board
which will collect randomly spawning falling
points. 

If you collect the points it gets added to the 
total, if you miss them it gets reduced from 
your total. If your total reaches 0 you lose! 
After 500 total points 2 new blocks are unlocked.
